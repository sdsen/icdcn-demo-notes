**CALL FOR DEMONSTRATIONS**

ICDCN is a premier international conference dedicated to addressing advances in Distributed Computing and Communication Networks. ICDCN 2023 invites demonstrations from researchers, startups, and corporations to showcase operational systems or prototypes in the field of distributed computing and networking, and their applications. Inspired by the positive experience from previous years, this year also ICDCN is going to have a dedicated Demonstration session. The ICDCN 2023 Demonstration session provides a space for researchers to bring hands-on experiences to conference attendees. The session will be a unique opportunity to showcase technologies and applications to an international audience that is helping to build next generation systems. Participants of the demo session will get an opportunity to interact with topical experts and receive feedback; showcase their demo to industry partners, recruiters and investors.
